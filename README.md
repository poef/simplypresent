# Initial setup
Before starting the SimplyCode project, you need to do a few things before SimplyCode can work:

1. Change group to muze of all files and directories from the root folder

2. Change ownership and group to www-data
change the owner and group to www-data of the directories:
- www/data
- www/files
- www/img
- www/api/data

## Usage of this skeleton
When cloning this repo, you want to remove the remote origin by removing the .git/ directory and creating a new .git with `git init` .

This will ensure that you won't push any changes to your new project in this repository.

Another option is to fork this repository and work from that version.
