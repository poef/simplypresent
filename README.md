# SimplyPresent

SimplyPresent is a Solid Web Application made with SimplyCode.
To start working on SimplyPresent, cd to the src/ directory
and start ./simplycode.sh

This will startup SimplyCode as a docker image. Read the output
to find the URL to open.

If you just want to use SimplyPresent, you can copy the dist/index.html 
file into a Solid Data Pod. Then open that URL in a browser to edit the
slides.
